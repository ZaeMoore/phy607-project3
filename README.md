A Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation of the 2D Ising Model.


This script will produce a variety of data, including energies, magnetizations, lattice states, and more.

To run, simply install the package and enter "run-chain" in the terminal


The tests directory holds valuable guidance as well, including example outputs and jupyter notebooks.

testrun_neg1start.ipynb is an example run where the lattice was initialized with entirely -1 spins.

testrun_pos1start.ipynb is an example run where the lattice was initialized with entirely +1 spins.

testrun_randstart.ipynb is an example run where the lattice was initialized with random spins.

.png files in the test directory show example outputs. File names that end with "_n1start" are from runs where the lattice was initialized with entirely -1 spins. File names that end with "_p1start" are from runs where the lattice was initialized with entirely +1 spins. File names that end with "_randstart" are from runs where the lattice was initialized with random spins.
